Missing Receipt Data – Quick Update

Hi [Product Name],

I wanted to flag an issue we’ve noticed in our receipts data. Many receipts are missing key details like purchase amounts and dates, which makes it harder to track transactions and ensure accurate reporting.
We’re looking into possible causes, including whether there have been any recent changes in how receipts are processed. To resolve this, we need to understand if there are any known issues affecting the data and how we should handle missing information moving forward.
If this continues, it could impact our ability to generate insights and make data-driven decisions. We may need to adjust how we validate receipts to prevent these gaps. 

My calendar is open—feel free to book a time that works best for you so we can discuss next steps.


Thanks,
